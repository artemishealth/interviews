Build a dashboard that displays a list of users, their detailed profiles, and that supports basic interactions such as filtering and sorting.

User List:

Fetch a list of users from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users. Display the user data in a table or card layout, showing at least the following fields: name, email, and company. Add pagination to load a limited number of users per page (e.g., 10 users per page).

User Profile:

When a user clicks on a name in the list, display a detailed profile on a separate view or modal. The detailed profile should include all user's details and their posts (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts?userId=1) in a table or card layout.

Style as you'd like and use whatever component libraries you see fit.
