"""
Implement the function `random_walk` that simulates a 2-dimensional random walk.
In a 2-dimensional walk, at each step, the position should move either up, down, left, or right with equal probability.
After each step if the walker has returned home (where the walk started) print `"home"` and stop walking.
If the walker doesn't return home after the max steps of the walk print `"lost"`.
